# TheNature
A game, which was created during Eco Game Jam 2017 by Tynyanov Sergey and Segeda Michael <br />
Unity engine was used to make this prototype (it was first time I opened it, so don't criticize me :D Just kidding, do whatever you want, we live in a free country, aren't we?) <br />
This game took 3rd place on that jam btw :P So we are kind of proud of it... <br />
Sadly it wasn't finished ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
